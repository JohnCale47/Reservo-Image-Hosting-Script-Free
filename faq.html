<b>Is this free? </b><br>

Images not accessed within <?php echo $days_to_keep_images; ?> days will be removed.<br><br>

No. Most people use graphics editing programs such as PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro, or software that comes with printers, scanners, or digital cameras to edit their images.<br><br>

You have an unlimited amount of space for storing your images. <?php echo $site_name; ?> continuously buys harddrives to compensate for the amount of images that <?php echo $site_name; ?>'s visitors upload.
